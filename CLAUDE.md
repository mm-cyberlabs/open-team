# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Open Team is a JavaFX-based desktop application for team interaction and communication. The application uses a PostgreSQL database for data persistence.

## Current State

This repository is in its initial stages with only basic documentation files present. The actual source code, build configuration, and project structure are yet to be implemented.

## Expected Architecture

Based on the project description, the application will likely follow a typical JavaFX project structure:

- **Frontend**: JavaFX for the desktop user interface
- **Backend**: Java application logic for team communication features
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage
- **Build System**: Likely Maven or Gradle (to be determined when implemented)

## Development Notes

- This is a desktop application project, not a web application
- The primary technology stack is Java with JavaFX for GUI
- Database integration will be required for PostgreSQL connectivity
- Project structure and build configuration files need to be created

## Next Steps

The repository requires:
1. Basic Java project structure setup
2. Build configuration (Maven/Gradle)
3. JavaFX dependencies configuration
4. PostgreSQL database connection setup
5. Core application architecture implementation
